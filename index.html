HAPPIESTTT BIRTHDAYYYY MY CUTUUU 🤪🫶🏻😘❤️
OMGGG IT’S YOUR DAYYYY AND I’M LOSING IT 😭🤭🤪
Can you even process that today is the day you were born?? Like excuse me?? The universe really said let’s create someone dangerously cute 😎💥
idk how you did it, but you walked into my life so casually and somehow became my favorite part of it 🫠
You’re in my routine, in my head, in my heart — literally everywhere. And I wouldn’t change that for anything 🥺❤️
You make me feel safe and excited at the same time — which is unfair, btw 😤
The way you talk, the way you care, the way you EXIST… it drives me crazy in the best way 😍
And yes I’ll say it again because why not — YOU ARE SO FREAKING FINE 😤🔥
But listen… beyond the flirting and madness — you did something huge for me.
You helped me heal. You helped me get better when my mental health was a mess, when things felt heavy and confusing. You stayed, you listened, you made things lighter just by being you 🥹❤️
I don’t think I’ll ever stop being grateful for that.
You make me feel loved in a way that’s calm, warm, and real. And honestly? I want to be that for you too — someone who makes you feel wanted, valued, and adored 😌💋
Because you deserve that. Completely.
I feel insanely lucky that you chose me to open up to, to trust, to let into your world 🫶🏻
You make me believe in myself more. You make me smile more. You make everything better — and that’s dangerous information to give someone 😏
I care about you deeply, I want to see you happy always, and I want to keep making you smile like this 😘
HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY ONCE AGAIN MY BEAUTIFUL Babyyy 🎂🥳
Stay crazy. Stay soft. Stay irresistible.
And don’t forget… I’m always right here for you 😌💋🫶🏻
